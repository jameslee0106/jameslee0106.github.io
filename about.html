  <p class="intro-p">Hey there! My name is James Lee and I'm a full stack developer based in Seattle, Washington. I graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor's degree in business administration, concentrating in accounting and finance. </p>
  <p class="intro-p">My professional adventure began in the world of public accounting, where I served as a tax accountant for nearly two years. But life has had some unexpected twists in store for me. I found myself drawn to the ever-evolving space of techology, and I just knew I had to be a part of it. So, I took a leap of faith, bid farewell to my accounting job, and have since dedicated myself entirely to the world of technology.</p>

  <p class="intro-p"> Alongside two awesome business partners, I co-founded an LLC with a primary mission centered around blockchain technology and keyboard production. This entrepreneurial experience fueled my aspiration to dive into the field of software development, where I knew I wanted to be involved in creating and working with emerging technologies. </p>
    
    <p class="intro-p">Currently, my days are filled with enhancing my development skills and sharing knowledge as a coding instructor for K-12 students. Additionally, I'm working together with an amazing team of developers, where we collaboratively build full-stack projects in an agile environment, mirroring the dynamics of a professional workspace. </p>

    <p class="intro-p">Oh, I also LOVE sports! Find me at a nearby park playing basketball, catching baseballs, dinking pickleballs, and spiking volleyballs. Go Hawks! Go M's! Bring back our Sonics!</p>
