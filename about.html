  <p class="intro-p">Hey there! Iâ€™m James Lee, a full stack developer, accountant, and entrepreneur, based in Seattle, Washington. My academic journey began at the University of Washington, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Accounting and Finance. </p>
  <p class="intro-p">Kicking off my professional career in public accounting as a tax accountant, I delved into the intricate world of financial systems and analysis.</p>

  <p class="intro-p"> Beyond numbers, I ventured into entrepreneurship, co-founding an LLC focused on blockchain technology and keyboard production. This experience ignited my passion for the intersection of technology and business, steering me towards the dynamic realm of software development.</p>
    
    <p class="intro-p">Currently, my days are a fusion of honing my development skills and sharing knowledge as a coding instructor for K-12 students. Additionally, I collaborate with a talented team of developers creating full-stack projects within an agile environment.</p>

    <p class="intro-p">I love learning about emerging technologies and am excited for opportunities to take on new challenges. I'm a huge Tottenham Hotspurs fan and remain hopeful for a Premier League Championship win. </p>
